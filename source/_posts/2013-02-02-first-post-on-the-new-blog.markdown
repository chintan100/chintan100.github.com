After spending a week learning Jekyll/Octopress/GitHub Pages, I am finally able to start [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).

Being an iOS Developer, getting the hang of blogging with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) took some time but i highly recommend it for any developer who wants to escape the security updates of WordPress or if you are just looking for an adventure. I also had the added advantage of not having any previous blog posts to migrate but even if you have a blog already, there are [migration steps](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Blog-Migrations) available for almost every blog engine out there like WordPress, Movable Type, Posterous, Tumblr, Blogger (Blogspot) etc. and the list still goes on.

After playing around with Jekyll and [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) for a few days, i soon realized it will be a waste of time trying to set up a blog with a responsive theme all by myself due to my limited web development skills. It was at this point that i discovered [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) which felt like it was designed especially for people like me who are developers but not necessarily web developers and after i found out [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/) too uses Octopress to host his blog with the default theme, the path ahead for me was clear. 

I do have a HostGator shared hosting account but looking at the [sheer number of blogs](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites) hosted from GitHub, i decided to try out hosting the blog on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Since hosting on GitHub Pages is free, now my blog only costs the domain renewal fees (10-15 USD/year) and not hosting + domain renewal fees (~120 USD / year). Money staying in the bank is always a good thing. :)
